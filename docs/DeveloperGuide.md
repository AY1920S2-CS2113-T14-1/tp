# Developer Guide

## Design & Implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}


## Product Scope
### Target user profile

History Flashcard (HF) is for those who are studying history subjects to create flashcards which summarize 
the most important information for historical events, figures and artifacts. HF is optimized for those who 
prefer to use a simple Command Line Interface (CLI). 

### Value proposition

History is a subject that usually relies on heavy memorisation of a large amount of content. In order to 
make revision easier for history students, HF includes features that help with memory retention and organises 
information in a way that makes it convenient to review.

In HF, information can be entered in the form of flashcards with different fields, such as the name of the 
historical event/person, the relevant dates, and a summary. Flashcards can be categorised into user-defined groups
 to enable students to organise their knowledge better. Users can also create daily study plans.
 
 In addition, the user can shuffle and display random flashcards for revision.
