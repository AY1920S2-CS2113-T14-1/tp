Title: Resurrection Stone
Summary: The Resurrection Stone is one of the fabled Deathly Hallows.
Details:
* In "The Tale of the Three Brothers", it was the second Hallow created, supposedly by Death himself
* It was bestowed upon Cadmus Peverell after he requested, as his bounty, something with the power to recall loved ones from Death
* According to legend, whoever reunited it with the other two Hallows (the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility) would become the Master of Death
